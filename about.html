  <p>Todaloo Todo was created as a manager of your ever-changing, constantly growing list of things to get done, whether it's in a day, a week, or a month.
  It's simple.  All you have to do is enter in any tasks that need to be taken care of, along with any specific information needed to create that task.  We were in need of a simple platform accessible by all of our team members that would hold every person accountable for their responsibilities. Shortly after, Todaloo Todo was born and we've been using it ever since.  We hope you enjoy our site and that it really helps with your task management!
